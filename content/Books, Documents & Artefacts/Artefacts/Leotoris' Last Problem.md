it A crumpled up piece of paper that contains the last problem [[Professor Varitan Leotoris]] wanted to solve before his death. He passed it on to [[Chenris Tallfellow â€ ]] at the moment of his death and his last wish. 

Chenris was meant to burn it as a part of [[The Black Ritual]] but kept the real one to himself, ultimately making the whole ritual fail. It is currently in [[Mordecai Reverence]]'s possession
