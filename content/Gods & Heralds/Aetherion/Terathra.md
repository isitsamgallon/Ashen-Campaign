# History
[[Kal Korrigan]] first made contact with it by casting [Speak with Animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2258-speak-with-animals) on the crystal at [[Saleh Tower]]. Korrigan then managed to have a full conversation with it by meditating on the tree in [[The Tower of Ishnmel]].

[[The party]] had a second conversation with it after [[Aidan Knight]] was possessed by [[Chronovorus]] in [[Ishnmel]]. One of the time distortions was on [[The Tower of Ishnmel]] making Korrigan incredibly scared for Terathra's safety. After the distortion was lifted, the party tried to communicate through the same method Korrigan did the day before. Accept this time, Korrigan, [[Mordecai Reverence]] and [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] shared the burden of allowing the whole party to speak. 

Terathra was feeling strange and noted that something about the crystal at the top of [[The Towers]] could be wrong. [[Chenris Tallfellow]] is the only person free who can teleport up the tower and see what is wrong. When he arrives, he finds 2 [[Magic Demons]] with the crystal. Chenris decides to destroy the crystal and after some hesitation, gives the energy back to Terathra. Leading to [[The Tower of Ishnmel]] falling. Please see [[Session 15]] for more information.

On the third conversation, Korrigan talks to Terathra alone and Terathra is overjoyed about Korrigans return. They talk in depth and discover information about [[Uti, The Dragon]] and the [[Sword of Whispers]].
