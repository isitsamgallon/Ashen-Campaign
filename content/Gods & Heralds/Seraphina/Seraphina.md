The Compassionate One, Bringer of Health. Although there is no distinction between the moral standing of the deities, she often considered the closet to being a 'moral good' God. It seems she has temples in most major cities that can be used to access healing. 

Each of her temples has a [[Healing Guardian]], which also acts as her [[Herald]], that provides all the healing for the people in place of Seraphina since she is unable to enter [[The Amber Realms]]. It was revealed early on that Seraphina hates [[Aeloria]].

# Known Temple Locations:
