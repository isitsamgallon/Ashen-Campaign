The Goddess of Light, Bringer of Knowledge. She dedicates herself to bringing hope to the inhabitants of [[The Amber Realms]] and teaching them how to survive. She has no physical form in [[The Amber Realms]] however she often pulls people up to The Golden Plain to communicate with her directly, where she chooses to take the form of an elven woman wearing all white. 

She has a group of followers known as [[The Golden Ones]] who sign a pact with her on initiation meaning that she gets their eternal soul to act as a researcher while they get whatever knowledge they may require.

Aeloria is seen as generally a good god who dedicates herself to bringing hope to the inhabitants of [[The Amber Realms]] and teaching them how to survive. However, she can also be quite cruel in what she asks for in return for knowledge like when [[Chenris Tallfellow â€¡]] and [[Mordecai Reverence]] visit her room in the [[Session 20#Aeloria's Room|All Father Temple]].
