A Dwarven automaton found in the [[Ancient Dwarven Stronghold]] under [[Steelwick]]. Bruce was originally built as a care taker for the stronghold, chasing off invaders and supporting where needed. eventually al the dwarves left in one way or another and he was left alone. Until [[Corvus]] made his home in the stronghold and became fond of Bruce.

Eventually the party found Bruce and took a liking to him. However Bruce was only powered by lava at the time, Chenris was able to make a semi functioning battery for Bruce so they could take him to [[Strixhaven]] to give him a proper engineer to run on. the Party managed to fix an airship core to him giving him a lot of power but also making him slightly buoyant - requiring him to be weighed down. 

[[Chenris Tallfellow]] has taken a particular liking to the robot.
