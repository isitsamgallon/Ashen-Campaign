# Basic Information 
Chenris has a pale complexion and long grey beard and hair. Chenris is a bit of a know-it-all magic user with a pension to talk down to people who aren't as smart as him. He seems to know a lot or at least a way to find out about something he doesn't know. However there are some weird gaps in his knowledge - like how to walk the right direction.

# Dossier Report on Chenris Tallfellow
**Background Overview:**
In response to recent sightings of Chenris Tallfellow within the [[Strixhaven]] campus, I have initiated a comprehensive dossier report to illuminate his history prior to and during his tenure at [[Strixhaven]] University.

**Family Background:**
Chenris Tallfellow's upbringing unfolded within the residential confines of [[Strixhaven]], marking the continuation of a storied lineage once steeped in Eladrin nobility. However, the Tallfellow family's illustrious legacy was tarnished by --REDACTED--

**Transition to [[Strixhaven]]:**
--REDACTED-- endeavored to instill in Chenris the customs and traditions of Eladrin high society, including etiquette and martial training, in a bid to --REDACTED--

**Academic Journey:**
Upon reaching the age of enrolment, Chenris demonstrated exceptional aptitude, effortlessly passing the entrance examination. Assigned to the Silverquill house by his mother, Chenris's academic journey diverged from the traditional path of Eladrin nobility. Despite his familial aspirations for social integration, Chenris eschewed societal expectations, immersing himself in the pursuit of knowledge and magical mastery.

His academic pursuits encompassed a diverse array of disciplines, ranging from abjuration to conjuration, reflecting his insatiable curiosity and intellectual flexibility. Library records reveal Chenris's voracious appetite for learning, characterized by eclectic reading habits and a propensity for exploring diverse subject matter.

**Interpersonal Connections:**
--REDACTED--

**Catalytic Tragedy:**
The trajectory of Chenris's academic career was irreversibly altered by the untimely demise of Professor Leotoris during a field expedition. The circumstances surrounding the incident remain shrouded in ambiguity, but Chenris's involvement in triggering a fatal trap precipitated the tragic loss of his mentor.

Professor Leotoris's final directive to Chenris, coupled with the stark reality of mortality, catalyzed a profound existential crisis within the young mage. Faced with the impermanence of life and driven by a desperate quest for longevity, Chenris clandestinely delved into forbidden necromantic lore, breaching the sacred confines of the restricted section.

**Consequences & Expulsion:**
Regrettably, Chenris's unauthorized pursuit of forbidden knowledge compelled decisive action. In adherence to our institutional regulations, I made the difficult decision to expel Chenris from [[Strixhaven]] University. His subsequent banishment from the realm of mortal academia underscores the severity of his transgression and the enduring repercussions of his actions.

**Conclusion:**
Chenris Tallfellow's academic journey, marked by familial discord, intellectual fervor, and tragic loss, illuminates the complex interplay of ambition and consequence within our esteemed institution. While his expulsion signifies a departure from the hallowed halls of [[Strixhaven]], the legacy of his tumultuous tenure serves as a cautionary tale and a testament to the enduring pursuit of knowledge amidst the tapestry of magical academia.

# History
Chenris was a part of the original trio that was kidnapped by [[The Red Cult]] at he beginning of the campaign in [[Session 0]]. [[Mordecai Reverence]] and [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]], through some creative spell casting, managed to break off their chains to free Darche and get out of the cult hide out. 

**DEALS**
Chenris has been known to interact with the Goddess [[Aeloria]] form time to time, often times this is to make a deal with her for knowledge or power. The first time he interacted with her was in a dream where she offered him an piece of information he wanted for an unknown cost. He immediately accepted and asked "What happened to [[Professor Varitan Leotoris]]?". Often these deals come at a cost of knowledge or ability. for example, this deal for [[Dispel Ancient Goblin Magic]] came at the cost of a spell slot. Here is a list of deals Chenris has made with [[Aeloria]]:
- Information on Professor Varitan
- [[Dispel Ancient Goblin Magic]] 
- The nation of which [[Terence Witherfeather]] is currently located. 

**[[THE BLACK RITUAL]]**
During [[The Black Ritual]], Chenris was the only member of [[The Party]] that did not offer to burn his [[Leotoris' Last Problem|most prized possession]] instead opting to burn a fake. He even thought he had gotten away with it until [[The Ethertwist Haunter]] returned during [[The War for the OFC's Freedom|The war for the OFC's freedom]].

#### Report on Chenris Tallfellow (Vol. I)
**Subject Overview:**
Chenris Tallfellow, a once-promising student of [[Strixhaven]], has recently embarked on a tumultuous journey, forming connections with a disparate group of adventurers. This report aims to document key events and interactions surrounding Chenris since his departure from the academy.

---

**New Associations:**
Chenris swiftly integrated into a diverse adventuring party upon leaving [[Strixhaven]]. His companions include [[Mordecai Reverence]], a troubled individual wielding magic and music; Wurinn "drache" fuuldrusch, a straightforward yet amiable barbarian; Kal, a rogue driven by financial pursuits; and Aidan Knight, an enigmatic rogue with peculiar access to small-scale chronomancy.

**Troublesome Beginnings:**
Chenris's journey commenced in the vicinity of the OFC, a region associated with the troubled Dawn Empire. Shortly after his arrival, he fell victim to a cult, only to escape captivity alongside his newfound comrades.

**Involvement with Divine Entities:**
[[The party]] found themselves entangled in a divine conspiracy involving the god [[Chronovorus]] and his black cult. The primary threat became [[the Ethertwist Haunter]], an agent of [[Chronovorus]]. Chenris and his associates, after a perilous journey, orchestrated a ritual to evade this formidable foe. The ritual required burning pages associated with the Haunter, along with cherished possessions. Notably, Chenris deviated from the prescribed course by retaining an artifact linked to an unresolved matter with his former professor, Varitan Leotoris.

**Unresolved Dilemma:**
Chenris's decision to withhold the truth regarding his lingering attachment to a problem assigned by Professor Leotoris raises questions about potential consequences. The efficacy of the ritual remains intact, but the undisclosed divergence from the prescribed procedure leaves uncertainties about the long-term implications for Chenris and his adventuring companions.

---

**Conclusion & Recommendations:**
Chenris Tallfellow's journey beyond [[Strixhaven]] has proven eventful and fraught with challenges. As Archmage and Headmaster, I recommend monitoring developments closely. The unresolved issue from his past and his deviation from the prescribed ritual may have repercussions yet to manifest. It is imperative to keep abreast of Chenris's activities and their potential impact on both his personal growth and the stability of our magical realm.

#### Report on Chenris Tallfellow (Vol. II)
**Subject Overview:**
This dossier serves as the second report on the activities of Chenris Tallfellow, a former promising student at [[Strixhaven]], Academy of Magic. Given his increasingly erratic behavior and entanglements with dangerous entities, it is vital to maintain an updated record of his actions for potential intervention in the event of an emergency. This report outlines his recent ventures, including covert operations, encounters with forbidden magic, and the unsettling developments surrounding his association with the [[Ivory Crest]] and other clandestine groups.

---

**Incident at the Council**
Subject was involved in a covert operation with companions [[Korrigan]] and [[Aidan Knight]]. Successfully infiltrated council offices to gather intelligence. During the mission, subject located classified documents on territorial sales and troop movements, but inadvertently triggered an alarm system connected to [[the Dawn Empire]]. This led to an escalation of hostilities between the Empire and external parties.

**Confrontation with [[Xekai]]**
During a critical encounter with [[Xekai]], a potentially dangerous member of the mysterious group known as [[The Auditors]], subject identified the use of forbidden magic and uncovered the truth behind the murder of [[Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Despite the high-stakes scenario, [[Xekai]] escaped through a portal, leaving the subject’s group with partial intelligence. Subject showed notable strategic restraint, but the situation highlights a lapse in anticipating magical tracking mechanisms.

**Artefacts Discovery & Study**
During an expedition to a wyvern’s lair, the subject retrieved ancient dwarvish books from a mysterious hollowed-out cave. His obsession with the acquisition of magical knowledge became apparent as he focused solely on the artefacts, despite the loss of a comrade (Kal). His fixation on deciphering these texts superseded his regard for the group's emotional state following Kal’s demise.

**Involvement in Korrigan’s Transformation**
Subject became fixated on studying the entity known as "Korrigan" (a transformed version of Kal), engaging in extensive research into the connection between Korrigan and the deity [[Lorwyn]]. His behavior during this period suggests an unhealthy detachment from human emotion, treating the transformed Kal as a research subject rather than a comrade.

**Encounters with [[Strixhaven]] Researchers**
During an expedition in [[Steelwick]], the subject encountered researchers affiliated with [[Strixhaven]]. Notably, he made attempts to conceal his identity from them, suggesting underlying issues of guilt or fear regarding his academic standing. Despite Mordecai’s provocations, the subject’s identity remained hidden.

**Failed Negotiations and Loss of Credibility**
Subject displayed poor negotiation skills while attempting to trade luxury goods with the Adventurer’s Guild. His tendency to overvalue his position and knowledge of magic detracts from his ability to effectively handle mundane matters, casting doubt on his leadership capabilities during missions.

**Investigation of the Burning Library**
Subject displayed extreme emotional distress upon encountering a burning library, resulting in a temporary mental breakdown. His attachment to knowledge, particularly to texts, presents a vulnerability in high-stress situations where the destruction of intellectual property is involved.

**Research into [[Ivory Crest]]**
Subject was instrumental in uncovering the duplicitous nature of the [[Ivory Crest]] guild, though his reckless decision to investigate their premises nearly resulted in catastrophic consequences for the team. Despite warnings from allies, he proceeded to engage with dangerous elements of the guild, leading to the brainwashing of one of his companions (Drache).

**Interaction with Deities & Temples**
During visits to [[Aeloria]]'s and [[Seraphina]]’s temples, the subject was offered crucial information in exchange for forgetting his origins. His eventual decision to compromise knowledge of his family’s history reflects his growing ambivalence toward his past, signaling a significant shift in his values.

**Encounter with [[Arwen Gryffon]]**
In a subsequent encounter within the criminal underworld, subject’s behavior became increasingly erratic. His obsession with arcane knowledge pushed him to recklessly pursue information, leading [[the party]] into a notorious establishment run by dangerous figures. His involvement in the rescue of [[Aidan Knight]] during this episode highlights his resourcefulness but also his growing disregard for personal safety.

---

**Concluding Observations**
Chenris Tallfellow exhibits an exceptional aptitude for magic and learning, with a natural inclination toward the pursuit of arcane knowledge. However, his emotional detachment and obsessive tendencies have led to frequent clashes with his companions and an increased risk of mission failure. His disregard for social conventions and personal safety when magical knowledge is at stake has resulted in strained relationships within the group, as well as numerous instances of poor decision-making in high-stakes environments. Further psychological evaluation is recommended to assess his long-term viability as an adventurer.

#### Report on Chenris Tallfellow (Vol. III)
This report provides a comprehensive update on Chenris Tallfellow's recent actions and activities, following his previous report. [[The party]] encountered various challenges, including an assassination attempt and a dangerous cult, before continuing their journey to [[Ehobel]]. Chenris, once a promising student at [[Strixhaven]], has displayed increasingly unstable behavior and involvement in hazardous situations, necessitating an up-to-date record for emergency reference. 

---

Following a chaotic encounter, [[the party]]’s efforts to manage a crisis came to a head. [[Mordecai Reverence]], [[Terence Witherfeather]], and [[Korrigan]] managed to neutralize [[Aidan Knight]] before any further harm could occur. Chenris Tallfellow took swift action to stabilize Aidan, preventing his death. However, the arrival of a goblin mage, who increased the gravity in the area, left [[the party]] incapacitated and struggling.

Chenris, recognizing the use of Ancient Goblin Magic, attempted to dispel the enchantment. His efforts, though valiant, only allowed him to free one individual at a time. He succeeded in freeing Korrigan, who then attempted to attack the mage but missed as the mage turned invisible.

**Battle with the Goblin Mage:**
Chenris freed himself and collaborated with Korrigan to locate the elusive mage. Despite landing a few hits, their efforts were insufficient to subdue the mage. Meanwhile, Mordecai observed [[Arwen Gryffon]] approaching with a legion of goblins. In a desperate bid, Chenris used Misty Step to teleport directly to the mage, but his Inflict Wounds spell missed its mark. Subsequently, the entire party succumbed to unconsciousness.

**Escape from the Goblin Mine:**
Our records show, that while they were unconscious, [[the party]] were transfered to a nearby goblin-ran mineshaft located under the Verdant Spine. Imprisoned and guarded by goblins, [[the party]] faced dire circumstances. Korrigan’s charm on one guard led to the other demanding the charmed goblin’s execution. Reluctantly, Korrigan released the goblin, sealing its fate. [[The party]] was forced into labor, during which Drache unearthed unsettling eyes in the wall. Chenris utilized Thaumaturgy to simulate a cave-in, causing the goblins to panic. Drache discovered a hidden tunnel, leading the goblins to direct [[the party]] down it.

**Planning an Escape:**
Mordecai and Drache conspired in Draconic, while Korrigan and Chenris communicated in Primordial. Their plan involved Korrigan summoning a bird, [[Zephyr]], for Drache to scout the area. [[Zephyr]] revealed a group of 60 goblins and a precarious door leading to the outside. The door opened to a grim scene of dead humanoid slaves, underscoring the urgency of their escape. After the goblins passed, [[the party]] eliminated their captor and sent [[Zephyr]] back to retrieve their equipment.

Once their belongings were recovered, [[Terence Witherfeather]] opened a portal to their gear, leading them to the [[Iron Forge| Ancient Dwarven Stronghold]]Ancient Dwarven Stronghold]]'s library. Using a secret exit from the captain’s quarters, they escaped unnoticed, emerging in [[Steelwick]].

**The Trial of [[Steve Ulan]]:**
[[Steelwick]] lay deserted as night fell. [[The party]] headed to the [[Adventurers Guild]], where [[Boris Johnson]] informed them that most residents were attending the trial of [[Steve Ulan]] for the murder of [[Lord Ulan †]]. [[The party]] opted for rest, while Aidan searched for his missing horse and spent the night in a tree.

The following morning, Mordecai, still vexed with Aidan over past events in [[Minatota]], used Hideous Laughter to topple him from his tree for amusement. Drache persuaded Mordecai to consider [[Steve Ulan]]’s plight, arguing that Steve deserved a second chance due to his misguided actions. Chenris, however, remained unsympathetic, believing Steve’s predicament was his own doing. Chenris and Korrigan visited the local library, where Chenris discovered a tome titled _[[An Incomplete Guide to the Gods]]_ to further his knowledge about [[The Ashen Pantheon]].

To gain entry into the courtroom, [[the party]] donned disguises. Mordecai dressed Drache in drag and altered his own appearance using Disguise Self to resemble a tall, imposing human. Mordecai's accidental reference to Drache as his wife aroused suspicion in the racially prejudiced town. Inside the courtroom, they encountered [[Xekai]] providing a character reference for [[Steve Ulan]]. Mordecai’s defense speech won some support, but Drache’s attempt to persuade the audience led to many fleeing in fear, deepening Steve’s despair.

Korrigan burst into the courtroom, declaring that the [[Goblin Mafia]] was planning an attack on the city. His dramatic interruption hastened the trial proceedings, though Steve was still sentenced to execution. As they exited, [[Xekai]] provided a note detailing Steve’s cell location and a time for a planned breakout.

**Quest to [[Dustwood]] and [[Farpost]]:**
[[The party]] met [[Xekai]], who suggested delivering a note to [[Farpost]] and gathering reinforcements from [[Dustwood]] for [[Steelwick]]. [[Xekai]] opened a portal to [[Dustwood]], expediting their journey. On the way, Chenris and [[Korrigan]] struck a deal involving [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]]’s soul contract, leading to Chenris learning about [[the Ancient Pillars]] and Korrigan’s hidden agendas. Their navigation faltered due to Chenris and Korrigan’s leadership, but Mordecai corrected their course.

**Encounter with [[Merchant Guild]] Caravan:**
[[The party]] encountered a [[Merchant Guild]] caravan loaded with weaponry, but interaction was refused. Chenris noted the heavy guard presence and inferred the caravan’s destination was [[Farpost]].

**Arrival at [[Farpost]] and [[Commander Arez †]]:**
Upon reaching [[Farpost]], the town was in defensive preparations. [[The party]] delivered their notes to [[Commander Arez †]], who mobilized troops for [[Steelwick]]’s defense and planned to engage the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]]. Arez rewarded [[the party]] financially and departed to organize his forces. Chenris scrutinized the battle map, taking note of troop positions.

**Return to [[Steelwick]] and Aidan’s Confession:**
[[The party]] returned to [[Steelwick]] as night fell, settling at the [[Adventurers Guild]]. That evening, [[Aidan Knight]] confided in Mordecai about his inability to function outside of being a weapon due to a traumatic childhood. Mordecai offered encouragement, and a group hug followed, though Chenris and Drache excused themselves.

**Meeting [[Merek the Wise]]:**
Chenris encountered [[Merek the Wise]] during a morning walk and, deeming Mordecai a “buzzkill,” chose to inform Korrigan. Korrigan, enraged, teleported Merek to the [[Feywild]] and tried to uncover his true name, which Merek refused to divulge. Despite Merek’s refusal, Korrigan eventually gifted him a token. Meanwhile, Mordecai prevented others from alerting the guards about Merek’s disappearance, spinning a tale of Korrigan and Merek’s private moment.

**Rescue Plan for [[Steve Ulan]]:**
With [[Steve Ulan]]’s hanging imminent, [[the party]] devised a rescue plan. Korrigan created a vine net as a safety measure for Steve’s fall. Mordecai used Disguise Self to pose as a guard and, along with Aidan, convinced the actual guard to leave. They freed Steve and revealed their escape plan.

**Unexpected Arrival of a Black Dragon:**
At 3 a.m., a massive black dragon sent by [[The Auditors]] arrived at the tower’s window. The dragon, unfamiliar with [[Xekai]], allowed Steve, Mordecai, and Aidan to board. Chenris, stationed on the streets, distracted the guards as the dragon approached. Mordecai informed Chenris not to panic, as they were being rescued. The dragon subsequently picked up Chenris and Drache.

**Flight to the OFC and Meeting [[Genevieve †]]:**
The dragon transported [[the party]] to the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]], where [[Xekai]] and the city of [[Blackwall]] were preparing for battle. [[Genevieve †]] coordinated the defense efforts, while the [[Goblin Mafia]] attempted to strike a deal with her.

**Goblin Troupe Deal:**
After deliberation, [[the party]] decided to employ the goblins as sacrificial pawns, despite Chenris’s suggestion. The vote was 4-1 in favor of hiring the goblins, though [[Korrigan]] had to be physically coerced into signing the contract.

**Rest at the Minister's Rooms:**
[[The party]] enjoyed a luxurious stay in the minister's rooms, complete with 24/7 baths. They overslept, and during the night, Aidan stole Chenris’s cloak, prompting a confrontation. Chenris, angered, led to a discussion about [[the Ethertwist Haunter]]. Aidan downplayed the issue, heading to the council room where [[Genevieve †]] awaited.

**[[Genevieve †]]’s Frustration and War Strategy:**
[[Genevieve †]] expressed fury over [[the party]]’s oversleeping and the chaotic presence of various forces within [[Blackwall]]. Chenris presented a comprehensive strategy: creating an impassable storm to thwart a sea attack, positioning trolls for a pincer maneuver, and using fairies to transform soldiers into dinosaurs for additional firepower. [[Genevieve †]] approved the plan, and [[the party]] boarded [[the black dragon]] for the front lines. Mordecai delivered a stirring speech, with Chenris enhancing through Thaumaturgy.

---

**Conclusion:**
In the wake of their harrowing escapades, [[the party]]’s journey has revealed both their formidable strengths and their frailties. From the treacherous escape from the goblin mine to the high-stakes battle that determined the fate of the Organisation of Free Cities, Chenris Tallfellow and his companions have navigated a labyrinth of danger, intrigue, and moral complexity. Despite their occasional discord and individual flaws, their collective resolve and resourcefulness have emerged as their greatest assets. Chenris, in particular, has demonstrated a complex blend of brilliance and vulnerability, grappling with personal demons and unresolved pasts while striving to lead his allies through tumultuous trials. As they embark on new quests, their experiences thus far will undoubtedly shape their future decisions and alliances. The upcoming challenges in [[Silkhorn]] and beyond will test their unity and resolve further, but with each step, they forge their path forward, their destinies intertwined with the fate of the realms they traverse.

#### Report on Chenris Tallfellow (Vol. IIIV)
As is my growing concern with Chenris Tallfellow’s behavior and increasingly erratic decisions, I have accelerated the frequency of these reports. Each subsequent account uncovers more troubling patterns that suggest the once-bright student has veered ever further from the promise of his early potential. The following incidents, though varied in nature, illustrate a descent marked by moral ambiguity, reckless curiosity, and a disturbingly cold detachment from those around him. I remain gravely concerned about the trajectory of his actions and their ramifications on not just [[the party]] but on the fabric of the multiverse itself.

---

**The Mimic Escape**
Chenris and his companions found themselves in a house entirely constructed of mimics, a fact that he deduced with alarming swiftness. It was a clever realization, yet the perilous environment demanded immediate action. Despite waking his slumbering allies in time, the situation escalated quickly as the house itself began a grotesque digestion process. Chenris’ tactical brilliance shone momentarily as he utilized *Misty Step* to scout a path, but his quick decision-making seemed more self-preserving than selfless. [[The party]]’s narrow escape, in part facilitated by Chenris' coordination, was ultimately overshadowed by the violence that ensued. The mimic, locked and battling with his companions, was dispatched, but the question remains: why did Chenris, with all his intellect, not foresee the need for such a drastic exit strategy earlier?

**Arrival in [[Enelion]]**
Upon arrival in [[Enelion]], a coastal town, Chenris exhibited behavior far removed from his more academic roots. Inquiring about lodging, he slipped into an Elvish conversation with the receptionist, where he cavalierly referred to [[Aidan Knight]] as his "slave." Whether this was intended as a jest or a more insidious revelation of his true thoughts is unclear, but the fact that he would employ such language in a casual manner is deeply troubling. The receptionist’s immediate direction to the slave quarters might have been the result of Chenris’ sharp tongue, but it was his willingness to play along that I find most disturbing.

The blood test that followed confirmed Chenris’ noble lineage—an unsurprising fact, but one that elicited unsettling behavior from his companions. In particular, his handling of the receptionist’s deference, addressing him as "Lord Tallfellow," seemed to feed his growing arrogance. His immediate transition into a luxurious pocket dimension raised more questions than it answered. What does Chenris intend to gain by flaunting this noble birthright, and to what end?

The luxury of their temporary lodgings was soon marred by a prank Chenris orchestrated. Angered by Aidan’s previous theft of his cloak, Chenris stole Aidan’s prized dagger and had a slave dispose of it via portal, ensuring its permanent disappearance. While pranks and minor acts of revenge are not uncommon in adventuring parties, the casual cruelty with which Chenris enacted this one is unsettling. He reveled in the discomfort it caused Aidan, making a mockery of the dagger's disappearance over breakfast while Aidan frantically searched for it. The cold calculation behind the prank suggests a growing callousness in Chenris’ psyche, one that could endanger the unity of his party.

**The Audience with Empress Yelris**
The manner in which Chenris and his companions sought favor with Lord Folre [[Enelion]] to secure an audience with Empress [[Obeus Yelris]] continued to highlight Chenris' manipulative tendencies. While the rest of [[the party]] flattered Lord [[Enelion]], Chenris quickly capitalized on the favor and disengaged, moving away from the situation with haste. His use of social maneuvering is impressive, but it is the underlying intent that concerns me. Chenris has become adept at using people to advance his own goals, and I fear what this skill might evolve into, given time.

**Aidan's Dagger Scam in [[Nas Anor]]**
Chenris' involvement in Aidan's scheme to sell and then magically recall his dagger in [[Nas Anor]] further illustrates his willingness to engage in morally dubious activities. While his sale of wyvern poison might be deemed pragmatic, the overarching trend of behavior speaks to a growing detachment from ethical concerns. It is as though Chenris views every interaction, every decision, as a piece in a larger game—one where only the end goal matters, regardless of who might be hurt along the way.

**Lost in the Forest and Cannibal Encounter**
Once again, Chenris led the group astray, resulting in their encounter with [[elven cannibals]]. His attempt at broken Elvish, while arguably brave, revealed an unpolished grasp of diplomacy, one that left much to be desired. Yet even here, Chenris’ pragmatism won out. Through quick thinking and persuasion, [[the party]] escaped with their lives. However, the sheer recklessness of his decisions leading up to this encounter—his misplaced confidence in navigating the forest—nearly cost his party dearly. His growing sense of invulnerability is deeply alarming.

**The Tower of [[Ishnmel]]**
It is in his obsession with towers like [[Ishnmel]] that Chenris’ most concerning qualities come to the fore. His academic curiosity has warped into something more dangerous, as demonstrated by the events at [[Saleh Tower]]. Chenris' determination to dismantle the crystal despite Mordecai's protests was nothing short of reckless. The fact that [[Ebis Daro]], a man whose allegiance remains suspect, joined forces with Chenris to complete this destructive act only deepens my concern. By breaking the crystal, Chenris absorbed immense energy, a power that could very well have catastrophic consequences. His choice to ally with a figure like Ebis suggests that Chenris' pursuit of knowledge has blinded him to the moral and ethical ramifications of his actions.

---

**Conclusion**
Chenris Tallfellow’s journey thus far has become an ever-darkening reflection of the student I once knew at [[Strixhaven]]. His brilliant mind, once a beacon of potential, now veers into dangerous territory—obsession, manipulation, and a disregard for the well-being of others. I will continue these reports in greater detail, as each step he takes seems to lead him further down a perilous path. The question remains: will Chenris realize the cost of his decisions before it is too late, or will his thirst for knowledge consume him entirely, along with those unfortunate enough to be caught in his wake?

#### Report on Chenris Tallfellow (Vol. V)
There is an unexpected solace in the matter of this report—an easing of my long-standing concerns about Chenris Tallfellow. While his recent endeavors have been punctuated by alarming tendencies, this latest chapter reveals faint glimmers of restraint and self-awareness. The city of **[[Caalona]]** presented an extraordinary challenge—its illusions tailored to exploit the deepest desires of its visitors, creating a potent trap that could easily have consumed anyone with unresolved inner turmoil. Yet, amidst this chaotic experience, Chenris displayed a degree of caution and skepticism that had long been absent.

I suspect these changes stem from the harrowing events in **[[Caalona]]**, though it is unclear if his newfound restraint is permanent or fleeting. What follows is an account of [[the party]]’s journey through the illusion-ridden city and, more importantly, Chenris’ pivotal role in unraveling its mysteries.

---

**Return to the Adventurers' Guild**
Upon their return to the Adventurers' Guild, the group sought much-needed rest. By morning, their usual camaraderie had resumed, albeit with the same undertones of rivalry. **[[Mordecai Reverence]]** and **[[Korrigan]]**, ever mischievous, concocted a plan to outshine Chenris by busking for their breakfast. The intent was clearly to rile him—to provoke his competitive spirit. Naturally, Chenris, overhearing their schemes, responded predictably. However, instead of escalating the situation with overt trickery or confrontation, he chose to outwit them with subtlety. He ordered the most expensive meal available, complete with a fine bottle of wine. His demeanor, though still smug, displayed an almost playful restraint.

Mordecai, of course, was visibly irked by the success of Chenris’ counter-prank, but the exchange was devoid of the previous edge of malice. There is a peculiar softness to Chenris' victories now, as though he seeks to best his companions without truly damaging them—a nuance that gives me hope.

**Audience with the Empress [[Obeus Yelris]]**
The group’s next notable venture brought them to the palace of Empress [[Obeus Yelris]]. Despite her notorious unavailability, Chenris played a critical role in securing an audience. Alongside Korrigan and **Wurinn "Drache" Fuuldrusch**, Chenris' persistence bore fruit, convincing both the guards and eventually the Empress herself of the importance of their news. His handling of the Empress, however, showed an intriguing mix of formality and subtle challenge.

Addressing her with the respect due to her station, Chenris presented her with the threat of the bandit camp and the weapon known as **[[Grom]]**, using _Mage Hand_ to pinpoint critical locations on a map. Yet, when the discussion shifted to the fallen Tower of [[Ishnmel]], a topic of deep concern, Chenris showed uncharacteristic boldness, questioning the Empress' confidence in the tower's defenses. His tone was far from deferential—he hinted that the prior victory of [[the Coalition]] had been mere luck, a remark that the Empress received with cold indifference. Still, Chenris’ insistence on presenting his own perspective, despite opposition, demonstrated a growing sense of responsibility.

Perhaps even more significant was his proposal of a trade deal between the **[[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]]** and [[Ehobel]]. A clear nod to Chenris' tactical mind, this suggestion was well-received by the Empress, who congratulated [[Ehobel]] on its recent victory. While his motives remain multi-layered, it was a rare moment in which Chenris seemed more statesman than schemer.

**The Empress’ Desire to Escape**
What followed was more troubling. The Empress confided in the group her desire to escape her gilded prison, and it was Chenris who immediately began plotting with Mordecai. Pulling him aside, Chenris requested his aid in infiltrating the palace, acknowledging Mordecai’s talents for distraction. When Mordecai questioned whether Chenris took him for a fool, Chenris' blunt response—"yes"—was emblematic of his typical, unflinching candor. Yet, this partnership hinted at a rare alliance born out of necessity rather than rivalry.

**The Palace Break-In**
During the subsequent break-in, Chenris’ **[[Clockwork Bird]]** played a pivotal role. While Mordecai distracted the guards, Chenris used his bird to create the illusion that the Empress remained within her chambers, allowing the group to extract her unnoticed. His quick thinking and deft manipulation of magical constructs were crucial in the success of their plan. Though Mordecai and the others executed the distraction, it was Chenris’ strategic foresight that ensured the operation's flawless execution.

**Confrontation with [[Ebis Daro]]**
Chenris’ inquiry into **[[Master Enel Cubus]]’** disappearance brought him to a perilous encounter with **[[Ebis Daro]]**, a figure whose shadow looms larger with each passing event. The meeting quickly unraveled into a surreal confrontation, with Ebis transforming into various disturbing figures, including the leader of [[the Red Cult]] and a familiar suicide bomber. The confrontation culminated in Ebis’ sadistic parting words: “And no one will believe you.”

Chenris, rattled, fled the scene—a rare moment of vulnerability for one so often in control of his emotions. His later attempts to make sense of the encounter were marked by uncharacteristic panic, and when **Korrigan** used magic to delve into Chenris’ mind, the revelation that their thoughts had been probed at some unknown point left the entire group shaken.

**[[Caalona]]’s Illusory Deception**
Upon their arrival, [[the party]] was greeted by **[[Caalona]]**, a city notorious to the mages at [[Strixhaven]] for morphing itself to suit the current deepest yearnings of its visitors. The malleability of the environment—an obvious illusory enchantment—allowed each member to perceive a vision tailored to their specific desires. **[[Aidan Knight]]** envisioned a city of comfort, with hot springs and massage parlors to ease his newly discovered magical abilities. **[[Korrigan]]**, drained of arcane energy, sought mana restoration, while **Mordecai Reverence** saw a playground designed for thrill-seeking.

Chenris, however, was drawn to something more sinister. His recent fixation on the regenerative powers of the **[[Elven Cannibals]]** led him to envision a “Magical Cannibal School,” where robed scholars eagerly handed him forbidden knowledge. Though alarming, this vision showcased Chenris’ obsessive need for knowledge—a trait that remains both his greatest asset and deepest flaw.

And yet, something subtle shifted this time. Unlike his previous reckless pursuits of forbidden magic, Chenris quickly sensed that the knowledge he was being offered in [[Caalona]] was hollow, fabricated. He detached himself from the illusion with a wary mistrust, recognizing the danger it posed before the others did.

**Suspicion & Subtlety**
Chenris’ encounter with the head researcher in his illusory library proved pivotal. Upon receiving a tome purported to hold the secrets of the **[[Elven Cannibals]]**, Chenris immediately grew suspicious. His newfound caution was evident in his skepticism—he did not blindly accept the knowledge presented to him. Instead, he tested the illusion, recognizing the excessive flattery as a manipulation rather than validation of his skills.

This moment of awareness is crucial. In the past, Chenris has been reckless, driven by the thirst for arcane power without regard for consequence. Here, he exhibited a maturity I have long hoped he would achieve. When he discovered the illusion's deception, he retreated and joined **Mordecai Reverence**, who had already broken free. Together, they hatched a plan to rescue the others.

**Illusions, Rivals, & a Dangerous Escape**
The rivalry between Mordecai and Chenris has been a source of tension within [[the party]] for some time, and it threatened to flare once more as Mordecai reveled in having “outsmarted” Chenris. However, their collective goal of freeing their companions from the city's thrall took precedence over petty competition.

Chenris re-entered the illusory city and encountered a fake version of Mordecai, further confirming his suspicions of the city’s deceptive nature. Using his wits, Chenris tested the imposter with a specific query that only the true Mordecai would know, forcing the illusion to crumble before him. The fact that he did not fall prey to the charm of the illusion demonstrates a growing resilience in Chenris, one that might allow him to overcome the darker inclinations of his mind.

Outside the illusion, the situation became increasingly dangerous as **[[Korrigan]]** and **[[Aidan Knight]]** remained ensnared by the false visions. Though Chenris and Mordecai succeeded in escaping the illusions themselves, they struggled to convince their companions of the reality. Korrigan, in particular, proved resistant—his paranoia deepened by the city's pervasive magic.

**The [[Illusion Master]]: A Choice Presented**
The climax of the ordeal came when Chenris encountered the **[[Illusion Master]]**, the malevolent architect of [[Caalona]]’s ever-shifting façade. In a moment that could have revealed Chenris’ true nature, he was offered a tempting deal: remain in [[Caalona]], where all his dreams could be realized, free from the constraints of reality. The [[Illusion Master]] promised protection and power—both tantalizing to someone of Chenris’ ambition.

Yet, Chenris did not accept. His skepticism, once again, overpowered his darker impulses. He rejected the offer, citing the artificial nature of the peace being offered. While I do not doubt that Chenris’ desire for knowledge and power remains strong, this moment reveals that he is not beyond hope. He may yet possess the discernment to distinguish between genuine growth and hollow shortcuts.

**Consequences & Strained Alliances**
Upon reuniting with his companions, Chenris found **Mordecai Reverence** drenched in the blood of elves—an unsettling result of the **Ethertwist Haunter’s** manipulations. Tensions flared as the group quarreled over a mysterious note, **Leotoris’ Last Problem**, a matter that Chenris has obsessively guarded. When **[[Korrigan]]** attempted to destroy the note, Mordecai intervened, taking an arrow for it and falling unconscious.

Chenris, though clearly shaken, healed Mordecai—an action underscored by his sarcastic comment about the [[Illusion Master]]’s intentions. This was not an act of compassion, but rather a calculated and spiteful decision to avoid proving his adversary’s grim predictions correct. Nonetheless, Chenris' ability to weigh the broader consequences of his actions is a positive development.

**Arrival in [[SIlkhorn]]**
After the dramatic conclusion of the events in **[[Caalona]]**, [[the party]] heads toward the bustling docks of **[[Silkhorn]]**, where **Wurinn "Drache" Fuuldrusch** awaits. **Mordecai Reverence**, eager to reconnect, rushes to embrace Drache and recount their harrowing adventures. Meanwhile, **[[Korrigan]]**, ever meticulous, creates a list of the group’s priorities titled "What good in the world can we do?" The first task: aiding Drache in breaking **[[Emmeline]]** out of captivity.

As [[the party]] begins to navigate the streets of [[Silkhorn]], an unsettling atmosphere greets them. The townsfolk, eerily cheerful and clad in uniform brown robes, prompt concern. **Chenris Tallfellow**, ever curious but growing clumsy with his rising self-doubt, causes a small commotion by accidentally pulling down a passerby’s trousers while attempting to investigate. His muttered apology—“Can’t do anything right these days…”—betrays the inner turmoil gnawing at him.

Their destination is **[[Captain Bridges]]**, whose recent close association with **[[Steve Ulan]]** might provide answers. Bridges, unusually upbeat, directs them toward **[[Azel †]]**'s church, a place they haven’t visited since leaving the town. When they arrive, the scene is surreal—what was once a modest sanctuary has transformed into a grand temple, with Steve himself leading a choir of worshippers singing hymns in [[the party]]’s honor. The disturbing undertones are undeniable, and both Mordecai and Chenris seem haunted by the morality of what they've unleashed.

The most jarring revelation comes when **[[Steve Ulan]]** joyfully explains that after executing **[[Azel †]]**—their racist enemy—he subjected [[Azel †]]’s followers to an “exposure therapy” experiment by locking them in a room with individuals of other races. **Mordecai** and **Drache**, alarmed by the ethical implications, quickly lay out the dangers of unchecked power: executing someone for their beliefs, forcing social change without consent, and the perils of glorification. Chenris, recognizing the merit of Steve’s attempt to address social division, nevertheless finds himself walking a fine line—acknowledging Steve’s idea but urging more humane methods.

Before leaving, they inquire about **[[Keith Horrigan]]**, who has mysteriously vanished. With few leads, they set off for **[[Blackwall]]**, where another unsettling mystery awaits.

**Whispers on the Wind**  
Chenris, while journeying through the countryside with his party, reported hearing unsettling whispers—"Brainsssss"—on the wind, a harbinger of dark forces. The normally vibrant woodland was eerily quiet, its stillness broken only by the macabre discovery of a dead bird, its brain removed with surgical precision. This disturbing scene grew worse when Drache detected the presence of four undead entities hidden in the branches of a nearby tree. The creatures, upon closer examination, were revealed to be undead squirrels, an absurd yet horrifying manifestation of necromancy, with one such squirrel wielding a staff imbued with dark power. Korrigan, with his usual unorthodox methods, used his talents to speak with the leader of the undead rodents. The squirrel spoke of a plan—grandiose in its absurdity—to amass riches through robbery, a notion that seemed more pathetic than dangerous.

Chenris, however, did not falter. In the ensuing exchange, when negotiations broke down and a squirrel thrall attacked, he deftly used his mage hand to steal the necromantic staff from its diminutive wielder, bringing a swift end to the encounter. Yet, it is troubling to note that Chenris's proficiency with dark artifacts is growing. He is increasingly comfortable in wielding such items, and his ease in resolving the situation through manipulation of necromantic power leaves me uneasy. Still, the group moved on to [[Blackwall]] without further incident, but the whispers, both literal and metaphorical, continued to linger.

**The Disappearance of [[Keith Horrigan]]**  
Upon arriving in [[Blackwall]], [[the party]] sought respite at a tavern, "[[Ye Old Tavern Down the Road]]," and it was here they began to gather information about the recent disappearance of one [[Keith Horrigan]]. Rumors in the city swirled like smoke, suggesting that Horrigan had somehow managed to steal everything from the palace, even the very furniture, all while the guards were mysteriously absent. The audacity of the crime, and the magical potential it would require, immediately raised suspicions within Chenris.

The investigation led [[the party]] to the palace itself. What they found there was a scene of such total desolation that it almost defied belief. The palace had been utterly stripped—every valuable, every gilded trimming gone. Chenris led the charge, uncovering a secret entrance in the palace vault, hidden beneath the surface and leading to a maze of tunnels. Mordecai, ever the opportunist, was sent forward to explore these narrow passages. His discovery of mining tools, oil lamps, and [[Gold]] coins indicated a sophisticated operation, but there was more to uncover.

**Hidden Knowledge and [[the Black Tower]]**  
While the others searched the palace, Chenris wandered into the forbidden section of the city’s library. There, amidst the dust-covered tomes of forgotten knowledge, he found a book detailing the history of [[Blackwall]], one that linked it to the ancient [[Grayfall Empire]], a dwarven stronghold from ages past. The city’s history was one of desperation—siege, secret escape tunnels, and ultimately, collapse. The book, cryptic though it was, pointed Chenris toward the beach where the old tunnels may yet lead, and perhaps where the stolen goods had been taken.

The discovery of [[Keith Horrigan]], barely alive with two daggers plunged into his chest, deepened the mystery. His story was one of betrayal, claiming that the dwarves—long dead or thought to be—had double-crossed him. Yet there were no signs of struggle, no evidence of the violence he described. The inconsistencies gnawed at Chenris, his intellect unraveling the threads of the tale, but the truth remained elusive. They healed Horrigan, stabilized him, and hid him within the council chambers, but there was no resolution. The specter of treachery haunted every step they took, and the tunnels beneath [[Blackwall]] held their secrets tightly.

**A Ghost’s Tale & the Crown of True Sight**  
Back at the library, the research continued. Korrigan searched in vain for information on "[[Itone]]," but Chenris's sharp eyes and insatiable curiosity led him to another book—The Chronicles of the [[Grayfall Empire]]. There, among the notes of a once-great dwarven civilization, he found the ramblings of a former dean, Enel Cubus. His writings, erratic and filled with madness, referenced places of interest: [[Eldertide]], [[Ember Peak]], and a mysterious group known as [[The Auditors]]. This discovery seemed to unsettle Chenris further; there are echoes of something larger at play, pieces of a puzzle that Chenris is keen to solve, though at what cost remains unknown.

Seeking additional knowledge, the group sought out [[Terence Witherfeather]], an old adventurer with a reputation for knowing strange artifacts. His tale of a ghost messing with his mind seemed to resonate with Chenris, who appeared increasingly fixated on the nature of perception and reality. Terence spoke of the Crown of True Sight, a legendary artifact that allows its wearer to see the world as it truly is—an object of immense power, and one Chenris's growing ambition may find irresistible. Terence suspected that the crown may now be in the possession of either [[Jub]] or [[Chatiz]], but Chenris appeared more focused on the possibilities it represented than on the details of its current whereabouts.

**Concluding Thoughts**
The events chronicled here mark a significant chapter in Chenris’ story—a chapter filled with growing internal conflict. His deft maneuvering during the audience with the Empress, his strategic brilliance in planning the escape, and even his handling of [[Ebis Daro]], all show a mind wrestling with forces far greater than mere academic curiosity or self-interest.

For now, I am cautiously optimistic. The young man who once sought only knowledge for its own sake now moves through the world with a heavier sense of responsibility. I will continue to observe him closely. His trajectory, though still fraught with peril, has taken a turn that brings me a modicum of relief. But whether Chenris Tallfellow will find his way back to the light, or fall deeper into the shadows that now encircle him, remains an open question.

As Chenris and his party prepared to leave [[Blackwall]], their path led them toward [[the Tulan Fort]], but the shadow of the past followed closely behind. Chenris’s thirst for knowledge, particularly of the arcane and the forbidden, grows unchecked. His quick thinking and mastery of magic have proven invaluable, yet there is an unease surrounding his choices—the books he reads, the artefacts he covets, and the dark forces he confronts with increasing frequency.

The line between curiosity and obsession is thin, and I fear that Chenris is beginning to blur that line. His once-bright potential is now shadowed by the weight of the knowledge he seeks. I will continue to monitor his progress, though I fear that his journey may lead him into dangerous waters, where even I may not be able to reach him.

# Trivia
- Due to a series of misunderstandings, Drache ships Mordecai and Chenris - much to their dismay 
- Chenris and Drache have a card game they always play when the rest of [[the party]] are busy. The card game is loosely based of Blackjack but was engineered by Chenris so that he could win nearly all of the time. Sometimes Chenris lets him win so they keep playing. 
- Chenris is known to have an absolutely horrible sense of direction. Often times [[the party]] will say they want to go somewhere and chenris will confidently walk in the opposite direction. He often try to play it off as he was testing them due to his pride. Mordecai has defaulted to putting some kind of lead on chenris so he can't just randomly walk in a direction.
	- Rowan has pointed out that Chenris' lack of direction is inspired by [Zoro from One Piece ](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Roronoa_Zoro), however this isn't true. [[Sam Gallon]] forgot about that and thought it would be funny at the time. he has since made it a bit more like Zoro's directional skills .
- [[Sam Gallon]] and [[James Absolom]] had been planning Chenris' betrayal during [[The Black Ritual]] for months before it was finally revealed to the party during [[Session 10]]. Sam also talked about it outside of the game to taunt and make sure no suspicion was on him before the reveal. 
- The reason why Chenris' note has a lot more time put into it is that [[Sam Gallon]] uses it as a summary of all their adventures as well to keep Strixhaven relevant in the background.
