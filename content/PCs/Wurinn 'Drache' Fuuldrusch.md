# Basic Information
Drache is 46 Years and not a lot is known about him except that he used to spend a significant amount of time working at [[The Tulan Fort]] before encountering [[The Party]].

Wurinn Fuuldrusch known primarily by his nickname Drache, is known to have ties to the Fort tulan mercenary group yet not much is currently known about his relations. He has spoken to [[Mordecai Reverence]] on occasion about the history of him and fort tulan but has not explicitly stated what occurred. He spent a large majority of his life working as a soldier but was always inclined to fight for the so called "little man", he is an optimistic man who attempts to see the good in people, if not a bit naive. 

Sometimes tension is caused by his intense moral compass as [[The Party]] may tend to act irrationally or with severe ill intent such as the murder of the kobolds during a random encounter, for which he still has not fully forgiven [[Korrigan]] for the brutal way in which he acted.

He is a charismatic and albeit somewhat flirtatious character whether he intends to or not and has his own way of sweet talking various characters, if all else fails he can tap into his more agressive side and utilize his size to be more of an intimidator, however it is rare he will use this.

After an ambiguous memorial during the banishment of the [[The Ethertwist Haunter]] and a clear reference during the visit to [[The Emerald Fort]], it is known that Drache had a lover many years ago known currently only as [[Emmeline]], Mordecai has a more intricate knowledge after hiding behind to observe the conversation between [[Genevieve †]] and drache however all of [[The Party]] are aware he would frequently visit this [[Emmeline]] during his time at fort tulan and are aware that he is in search of her to reunite.

Drache was a part of the original trio that was kidnapped by [[The Red Cult]] at he beginning of the campaign in [[Session 0]]. Mordecai and [[Chenris Tallfellow †]], through some creative spell casting, managed to break off their chains to free Darche and get out of the cult hide out. Along the way they picked up [[Steve Ulan]], although they we pissed off with Steve's racism, they wanted to change him for the better and functioning member of [[The Party]]. 

- **Notable Events**:

    - **[[Session 19]]**: Drache’s connection to the cult's exposure therapy and Steve’s controversial methods causes concern. His interactions with [[the party]] and the investigation into the cult’s methods are pivotal, showing his growing disquiet over moral and ethical implications.
    - **[[Session 19]]**: Drache continues to deal with the fallout from the cult's practices, striving to address the harm caused by Steve’s approach. He participates in exploring the tunnels beneath the palace and investigates Horrigan’s theft.
**Character Traits**:
	- Drache exhibits a strong sense of morality, struggling with the ethics of Steve’s methods and the overall situation in [[Blackwall]]. His commitment to resolving issues and seeking justice reflects his complex nature and dedication to his allies.
**Relationships**:
    - Drache is closely tied to his companions, particularly [[Mordecai Reverence]], with whom he shares a mutual concern for ethical practices and personal well-being. His interactions with other characters, such as Steve and Horrigan, reveal his deep-seated values and personal stakes in the unfolding events.

# Trivia
