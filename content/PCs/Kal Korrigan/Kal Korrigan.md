# Basic Kal Information:
Kal is Korrigan's original name before Kal's death. 
Kal (He/Him) was an average-sized Human Rogue/ Ranger Multi-class that preferred using bows in combat.  

# Kal History
Kal first meets the party (Only including [[Chenris Tallfellow †]], [[Mordecai Reverence]] and [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] at the time) on a quest to investigate a nearby area that had been raided.

After joining the party, he is know for being overall a nice person but is infatuated with gold and money - often having is judgement clouded whenever riches are involved. This was best exemplified when he took a quest to pick up a package and snuck off to collect this package against the party's best efforts to convince him not to. The quest was from the [[goblin mafia]] to deliver what was later revealed to be a bomb. Later on, after delivering the package to a the [[Blackwall]] base of the mafia. Kal was knocked out and forced to become a Suicide bomber for them to blow up the leaders of the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]]. 

[[Chronovorus]] initially offered to help the party out of this situation, but would only help if the party each gave up 50 years of their lifespan. It was then when [[Aeloria]] intervened by giving Chenris the ability to fix everything by trading a spell slot. 

Kal since became traumatised by this event and learned to not always be so money focused, becoming a reliable member of the team, using inventive solutions to the party's problems. 

Was forced into being apart of the [[Ivory Crest]] for 6 years while in [[Dawnhaven]]. Kal was forced to operate in that thieves guild due to a soul contract he was tricked into signing, a long lasting impact of the contract was infatuation with riches and gold. He was broken out of the contract by [[Terence Witherfeather]] 

**Kal's Death:**
Kal died in the session [[Session 2]] during a fight with a Wyvern. However his body soon disappeared in a mysterious light. 

# Korrigan:
**Basic Information:**

Korrigan seems to be some kind of Human/ deer hybrid. He's a Fey Touched Ranger with a particular attachment to animals.

The party first found Korrigan in session [[Session 3]] where called out the group for some food. He looked and sounded and looked exactly like Kal apart from the antlers, except Korrigan had none of his memories. Over the next few days adventuring with the party he seemed to remember a few things, including some kind of deal with [[Lorwyn]]. Korrigan has regained all of his memories apart from anything before [[the dawn empire]], he seems slightly insane when he's in a battle.

Korrigan seems to not understand some morals, he understands good and bad but doesn't see any issues as long as his actions help somebody or something.

Further on in the sessions, it is discovered that korrigan is a full fey being. However he confirmed that he was still Kal.

It was revealed that korrigan was the [[Herald]] of Lorwyn, he made a deal with the goddess to come back to life as her herald and perform a task for her. In exchange, Kal can resolve his unfinished business. It is later revealed that Korrigans deal with Lorwyn involved destroying the tower in [[Lost Haven]] and in exchange, Korrigan can finish his unfinished business.

Korrigan seems to be connected to lost haven significantly, [[Terence Witherfeather]] said that Kal got a lot of people killed there and a book ([[Mousebert & the Emperor's Folly]]) was discovered that Kal wrote along with [[Sera]] and [[Thorn]].

Korrigan also seems to have a special connection with [[Terathra]], the being at the centre of the planet and the power source to the [[Skyfall Ward]]. He wants to see his friend free from his prison without causing another sundering.
