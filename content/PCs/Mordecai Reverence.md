# Basic Information & History:
Mordecai was a part of the original trio that was kidnapped by [[The Red Cult]] at he beginning of the campaign in [[Session 0]]. Mordecai and [[Chenris Tallfellow]], through some creative spell casting, managed to break off their chains to free [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] and get out of the cult hide out. Along the way they picked up [[Steve Ulan]], although they we pissed off with Steve's racism, they wanted to change him for the better and functioning member of [[The Party]]. 

# History

Mordecai has since become the defacto leader of [[The Party]] as the only person with good social skills and common sense (and a sense of direction). Mordecai often tries to direct [[The Party]] to do the right thing, unless he as an interest in doing something to make himself look better or cooler. This is best exemplified when [[The Party]] went to the temple of [[Seraphina]] for healing and Mordecai was the only person to get fully healed because she appreciated that he always tried to do the best thing morally

Mordecai, despite being mostly focused on dealing damage, often helps out with healing since Chenris often forgets or refuses to heal people unless they're in his way. 

Mordecai seems to have a fear of fire, often refusing to use his fire based magic and having panic attacks when there's a large amount of fire in the area. Mordecai does not like to talk about his past, often dodging all questions relating to his past. 

During [[The Black Ritual]] Mordecai was seen giving up his cloak to the fire after giving it a good sniff to remember something from the past. 

Mordecai used to work for a bar in [[Minatota]], [[Uvam Dynasty]] called [[Nightshade's Crown]]. Mordecai had taken up a deal with [[Arwen Gryffon]] to make some quick money. Once Arwen had taken a bit more of a liking to Mordecai, Mordecai took of advantage of him and stole half his money and clothes and ran away.

Mordecai might have blown something up in [[Yokotori]].

**Trivia**
- Mordecais mini is based of a the female character model on Eldritch Foundry because the male models weren't "Twinky enough".
- Due to a series of misunderstandings, Drache ships Mordecai and Chenris - much to their dismay 
- Mordecai canonically does drag and fixed [[Korrigan]] up real good
