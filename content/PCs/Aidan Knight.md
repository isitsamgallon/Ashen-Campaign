# Basic Information:
Originally found in the middle of a time warp found surrounded by a forest fire that was accidentally created by [[Korrigan]] during a fight with goblins. Due to being born inside a time warp, he has the ability to manipulate time on a small/ local scale. Seems to be connected to [[Chronovorus]] as he particularly hates Aidan because of "what you did". Aidan often keeps to himself and loves to sleep in trees away from the party. 

# History
During a raid on a Chronovorus cult building, Aidan was key to closing the time warp and killed many of the cultists. During this combat, he managed to steal a dagger from the lead cultist called the "Edge of the Onyx Sands".

In session [[2]] Aidan manages to tame a horse while the party is asleep.

Aidan murdered a Tiefling who worked at [[Nightshade's Crown]] after being imprisoned by the workers their as well as [[Terence Witherfeather]] (against his will).

[[Korrigan]] and [[Mordecai Reverence]] beat him unconscious after Aidan threatened Terrence and Mordecai learnt about Aidan killing the Tiefling.
