Caden is the former head of the military for the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]]. Many people looked up to Caden as a source of hope that everything was going to be ok. He is a known [[Perpetual]].

The party first met Caden when they reached [[Blackwall]] for the first time, he was manning the gates. Later on, a huge airship crashed due to a wyvern attack and Caden needed all able-bodied fighters to help investigate the crash. During the process of investigating the ship and fighting the Wyvern, Caden was killed due to a tree falling. [[Xekai]] was later revealed to be behind this murder. 

Caden was later found alive and well after the party had verified his death and delivered his body to Blackrock. After a short analysis, [[Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] was able to conclude that someone had used powerful necromancy magic to control and resurrect Caden. 

Soon after finding this out, the party rushed to the government to tell everyone the news. They initially didn't believe the party until Caden walked in forces from [[The Dawn Empire]] and Chenris cast Turn Undead on the Caden. After the party defeated Caden and The Dawn's forces, they became the de facto head of the army until a new one was chosen. Caden's death shocked the whole [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]] as many believed he was the only one able to stop the Dawn's forces from completely taking over. 

Later on, the party adventured out to [[The Emerald Fort]] and met [[Genevieve †]] who revealed that Caden was an ex-soldier who defected from The Dawn to help from the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]]. It was also revealed that he fought in [[The Sundering]] 250 years ago.

Caden was revealed to be back again for the third time when revealed by [[Galen Verix]] at the end of the party's first meeting with the emperor. He then fought, against his will, in [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]] against the OFC where he was finally slain for good. 

After [[The Sundering]] [[Ashira Yelris †]] found herself trapped in a love triangle with [[Caden SteelBreaker †]] and [[Galen Verix]]. Ultimately she falls for Caden but it's considered Taboo to marry humans in Elvin culture so she promises to love Caden forever in secret.

Soon after she returned to [[Ehobel]], she was known to constantly leave the palace at night time and only return in the early hours of the morning looking incredibly drained. Over time she became so weak that she passed away.
