# Basic Information
Steve Ulan was found by [[Chenris Tallfellow â€¡]], [[Mordecai Reverence]], and [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] in the dungeon of [[The Red Cult]] at the start of the campaign. He was a very racist person but slowly as he regained his memories he became a lot more tolerant. He travelled with [[The Party]] for a good while before leaving [[The Party]] when they were investigating what was happening in [[Newhall]].

### Trivia
- [[James Absolom]] James originally planned for [[The Party]] to kill Steve because he was so racist and so had to quickly develop a back story for him since [[The Party]] showed no sign of letting him go. >:)
