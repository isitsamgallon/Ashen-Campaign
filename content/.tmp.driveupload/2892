### Prologue: The Prophecy of the Cleansing Flame

P.1. In the ancient days, it was foretold by the first prophets of [[the Ashen Cult]] that [[Ignatius]], the Cleansing Flame, would one day descend upon the mortal realm to purify the world in his holy fire. This prophecy, recorded in the sacred scrolls, spoke of a time when the world would be cleansed of its impurities and reborn in a new era of divine order.

P.2. The faithful followers of [[Ignatius]], guided by this prophecy, dedicated their lives to preparing for the day of his arrival. They sought to harness the power of fire and destruction, believing that through flames, true purity could be achieved.

### Chapter I: [[The Dawn Empire]] of [[the Sundering]]

1.1. In the year before the Seventh Era, the faithful of [[The Ashen Cult]], under the divine guidance of [[High Priest Lyrion]], sought to bring forth the cleansing flame of [[Ignatius]]. With fervent zeal, they harnessed the power of the sacred [[Ember Peak]], a vessel of divine fire and molten fury.

1.2. [[Ember Peak]], a towering volcano, had long been revered by [[the Ashen Cult]] as a conduit to [[Ignatius]]. Its molten heart pulsed with the essence of their god, and its fiery eruptions were seen as omens of his imminent return.

1.3. It was upon this sacred mount that [[the Ashen Cult]] initiated [[the Sundering]], a cataclysm to reshape the realms. They broke the [[Skyfall Ward]], a feeble barrier held by [[The Ancient Pillars]], thus allowing [[Ignatius]], the Cleansing Flame, to descend upon the mortal realm.

1.4. The [[Skyfall Ward]], an ancient and mystical barrier, had long been maintained by the weak magic of [[The Ancient Pillars]]. These pillars, scattered across the realm, were relics of a bygone age, their power waning with each passing century. [[The Ashen Cult]]'s scholars discovered that a concentrated burst of volcanic energy could shatter this barrier, paving the way for [[Ignatius]]'s arrival.

### Chapter II: The Ascension of [[Ignatius]]

2.1. [[Ignatius]], the fiery god of destruction, graced the world with his presence. His arrival marked the beginning of purification, as flames and death heralded [[The Dawn Empire]] of a new order. [[The Ashen Cult]], steadfast in their faith, embraced their transformation into [[Ash Spawn]], eternal servants of the Cleansing Flame.

2.2. The Ashen Cultists, in their devotion, willingly offered themselves to the flames of [[Ignatius]]. They believed that through their transformation into [[Ash Spawn]], they would achieve a form of immortality, becoming eternal instruments of their god's will.

2.3. [[Ignatius]] forged mighty weapons from the molten minerals of [[Ember Peak]], chief among them the [[Firesoul Greatsword]]. This weapon, imbued with dark incantations, turned enemies to ash and swelled the ranks of the [[Ash Spawn]], conserving [[Ignatius]]'s divine power.

2.4. The [[Firesoul Greatsword]] was a marvel of divine craftsmanship. Its blade, forged from the strongest metals and enchanted with the darkest incantations, glowed with an eerie light. Those struck by its edge were consumed by flames, their bodies reduced to ash and their souls bound to [[Ignatius]]'s will.

### Chapter III: The Scouring of [[The Desert]]

3.1. In the first year of [[the Sundering]], the [[Ash Spawn]] army spread across [[The Desert]], conquering villages and fortresses, turning the fallen into [[Ash Spawn]]. [[The Ashen Cult]] rejoiced in their growing might, yet they wisely withheld their fury from the [[Verdant Peninsula]], biding their time.

3.2. [[The Desert]], a harsh and unforgiving land, became the crucible of [[the Ashen Cult]]'s power. The [[Ash Spawn]], relentless and unyielding, swept through the sands like a fiery tempest, leaving devastation in their wake.

3.3. [[Ignatius]], in his divine wisdom, recognised the need for consolidation. The [[Ash Spawn]] army fortified their positions, preparing for the inevitable clash with [[the coalition]] forces of [[The Dawn Empire]] Empire and [[Ehobel]].

3.4. The [[Ember Peak]], their stronghold, became a fortress of fire and steel. [[The Ashen Cult]]'s blacksmiths worked tirelessly, forging weapons and armour from the molten minerals of the volcano. Each weapon bore the mark of [[Ignatius]], a testament to his divine power.

### Chapter IV: The First Battle and the Sacrifice of [[Seifer Willow †]]

4.1. [[The coalition]], led by the esteemed [[General Midus †]], faced a cunning adversary in [[Seifer Willow †]], an Ashen Cultist of great military acumen. Seifer's strategic brilliance culminated in a devastating explosion, a fiery testament to her devotion to [[Ignatius]], annihilating both coalition forces and her [[Ash Spawn]] comrades.

4.2. [[Seifer Willow †]], a master tactician, devised a plan to lure [[the coalition]] forces into a trap. Her [[Ash Spawn]] huddled closely around her, forming a living shield of fiery death. As [[the coalition]] army encircled them, Seifer unleashed the full power of [[Ignatius]], sacrificing herself and her comrades to obliterate the enemy.

4.3. [[Ignatius]] himself descended upon the battlefield, raising a new legion of [[Ash Spawn]] from the ashes of the fallen. This divine act foreshadowed the relentless onslaught that would besiege [[the coalition]], as their numbers dwindled and the [[Ash Spawn]] ranks swelled.

4.4. The battlefield, a charred wasteland, bore witness to [[Ignatius]]'s wrath. The god, with a mere gesture, reanimated the fallen, their souls bound to his fiery will. [[The coalition]], already weakened, faced a growing tide of [[Ash Spawn]] with each passing day.

### Chapter V: The Betrayal and Rise of [[the Goblin Resistance]]

5.1. Among the [[Verdant Peninsula]]'s inhabitants were the goblins, traders and survivors. Sensing the tides of war, the goblin general [[Chatiz]] sought to align his people with [[Ignatius]]. In a solemn act of devotion, [[Chatiz]] offered his eldest son to the Cleansing Flame, witnessing his transformation into an [[Ash Spawn]].

5.2. [[The Goblin Resistance]], now allies of [[the Ashen Cult]], disrupted coalition supply lines, weakening the resolve of their foes. City by city fell to the tide of [[Ash Spawn]], as [[The Dawn Empire]] Empire crumbled under the weight of divine retribution.

5.3. The goblins, skilled in guerrilla tactics, proved to be invaluable allies. Their knowledge of the land and their cunning strategies allowed them to sabotage [[the coalition]]'s efforts, hastening the fall of [[The Dawn Empire]] Empire.

5.4. [[Chatiz]], now a revered figure among [[the Ashen Cult]], led his people with a fierce devotion to [[Ignatius]]. His son's transformation served as a constant reminder of their divine purpose, inspiring the goblins to fight with unparalleled fervour.

### Chapter VI: The Siege of [[Dawnhaven]]

6.1. As the final days of [[the Sundering]] approached, [[Ignatius]] led his army to [[Dawnhaven]], the last bastion of [[The Dawn Empire]] Empire. [[The coalition]] defenders, led by heroes of great renown, prepared for a final stand against the inevitable.

6.2. The siege was long and gruelling, yet the defenders fought valiantly. In a climactic battle, the heroes faced [[Ignatius]] himself. Despite their valour, the god's might proved overwhelming. Only through divine intervention or the ascension of mortal might did [[Galen Verix]] pierce [[Ignatius]]'s heart, striking a blow against the god.

6.3. The defenders, though outnumbered and outmatched, held the line with unwavering courage. Their determination to protect [[Dawnhaven]] from the [[Ash Spawn]]'s fiery wrath became a symbol of hope for the beleaguered coalition.

6.4. In the final confrontation, the heroes devised a daring plan to confront [[Ignatius]]. They fought their way through the ranks of [[Ash Spawn]], their skills and teamwork allowing them to reach the god. The battle that ensued was the stuff of legends, a testament to the indomitable spirit of the mortal realm.

### Chapter VII: The Fall and Promise of Return

7.1. With a final, defiant snarl, [[Ignatius]] foretold his return, for a god cannot be slain permanently by mortal hands. As his physical form fell, the [[Ash Spawn]] disintegrated, their souls freed from the fiery bonds.

7.2. [[The Ashen Cult]], unwavering in their faith, await the prophesied return of [[Ignatius]]. They remain the wardens of the world, ready to rebuild society in the image of the Cleansing Flame, ever zealous in their devotion to the god of fire and destruction.

7.3. [[The Ashen Cult]] continues to spread the teachings of [[Ignatius]], preparing for the day when he shall return to finish the purification he began. They believe that only through fire can the world be reborn, and they dedicate their lives to this sacred mission.

### Epilogue: The Eternal Vigil

8.1. Thus concludes the sacred chronicle of [[the Sundering]], a testament to the divine will of [[Ignatius]], the Cleansing Flame. The faithful continue to spread his teachings, preparing for the day of his return, when the world shall be cleansed anew.

8.2. Praise be to [[Ignatius]], the Destroyer of Worlds, whose fiery embrace shall one day reclaim the mortal realm. Let every ember remind us of his divine presence, and may we, [[the Ashen Cult]], remain ever vigilant in our sacred duty.
