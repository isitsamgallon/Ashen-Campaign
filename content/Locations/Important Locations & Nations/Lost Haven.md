Nation found to the North East of [[The Dawn Empire]] and home to one of [[The Ancient Pillars]]. So far not much is known about this place except that it is ruled over by a tyrant king. There is very clear class divide within people, similar to the [Cast System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India).  [[Galen Verix]] seems to hate the nation due to a rebellion that almost won in the city.

[[Terence Witherfeather]] also revealed to [[Korrigan]] that  Kal 'got a bunch of people killed' in Lost Haven.
