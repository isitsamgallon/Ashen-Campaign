Sometime after [[The Sundering]], The OFC defected from [[The Dawn Empire]] after a particularly harsh skirmish with [[Ehobel]], during the [[4th Dawn vs Ehobel War]], where The Dawn refused to defend them and held the line at [[Whitespire]]. This led many of the residents of the area to grow disdain for The Dawn so they broke ties with it and became the OFC. 

It is assumed that [[Caden SteelBreaker â€ ]] also defected from The Dawn around this time but it is unclear exactly when this happened. Upon his defection, he soon became the leader of the armies and was known throughout the OFC as a powerful figure and as a beacon of hope for the ideals of the OFC.

[[Galen Verix]] disdains the OFC and everything that it stands for and wishes to take back the land and its people. Especially because it was revealed to [[The Party]] that the OFC is the perfect battleground in the fight against [[Ehobel]] as well as having particularly great trade routes via the seas. The emperor has already bought most of the land from the lords.

# Geography 
The OFC is made up mostly forest and high trees, making it great for ambushes. It is surrounded by water on most sides with only one way in through land using Whitespire, which acts as a natural choke point that can be used to effectively during combat.
