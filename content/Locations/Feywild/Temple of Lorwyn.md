A grand and magnificent temple, crafted from exquisite marble and accented with radiant amethyst, stands as a beacon of architectural splendour. Inside, the temple is adorned with intricately woven tapestries and statues that celebrate the lore of [[Lorwyn]]. A newly unveiled statue of [[Kal Korrigan]], holds a place of prominence, the chest cavity of korrigan is hollowed out and in its place is Korrigans soul. Each statue within the temple is infused with magical enchantments, some speak and some move.

The Temple holds the [[Seelie Court]]
