The home nation of the Humans in [[The Amber Realms]]. Around the time of [[The Sundering]] [[Ehobel]] and The Dawn were on good terms as they had just fought in a war with each other. However, some time after the events of the war the two nations fell out and now they are on the verge of war with each other again. 

It is assumed that the two nations are on bad terms with each other due to a difference in ideology between [[Galen Verix]] and [[Ashira Yelris â€ ]] on how to use and protect [[The Towers]].
