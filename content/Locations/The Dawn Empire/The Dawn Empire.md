The home nation of the Humans in [[The Amber Realms]] and led by The Emperor, [[Galen Verix]]. Galen is from a long line of Verixs who have ruled the nation for over 500 years after liberating it from the Dwarves in what came to be known as [[The Cleansing]] led by his ancestor [[Redmund Verix â€ ]]. The Dawn was one of the magic factions that made up [[The Coalition]] during [[The Sundering]]. During this period The Dawn had a very good relationship with [[Ehobel]] after many wars. However, sometime after the Sundering, the nations began to despise each other again, causing [[4th Dawn vs Ehobel War]] which sprouted the offshoot nation called The [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]].
