Strixhaven is the most prestigious magic academy in [[The Amber Realms]]. It is both a city and university and fazes in and out of the material plane, reappearing in different locations depending on the academy's needs and interests. The current Headmaster is [[Haldir Heleyarus]]. Their logo has an emblem of a bird on it, holding a banner. 

The city itself is made up of the residential district and then the university area. The university is made up of many floating islands that float on massive glowing rocks. Each island is linked to the main hall island. Each island then covers a different school of magic that the students can learn from. Either picking one school to specialise in or many. 

[[Chenris Tallfellow â€¡]] is known to have a dark past with the university when his beloved [[Professor Varitan Leotoris]] sacrificed himself to save chenris in a dungeon field trip. This act ultimately led to chenris being banned from the university. 

Members of Strixhaven were first seen when [[The Party]] left [[The Black Forest]] and burned down a building in [[Session 1]]. Strixhaven mages appeared out of nowhere and gave Chenris an evil eye before putting out the fire and leaving. They were later seen spying on [[The Party]] when they had made camp in [[Session 2]]. [[The Party]] officially met Strixhaven mages in [[Session 3]] when they came to investigate the[[Iron Forge| Ancient Dwarven Stronghold]] under [[Steelwick]]. [[The Party]] finally visits the university in [[Session 5]]
