A nation found to the south of [[The Dawn Empire]]. Its architecture is based on [Edo Period Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_period). Uvam is an [Anarchist Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy) with many of the towns and people free to do what they want, leading to them being extremely different from one another. Long ago they all banded together under one banner and each contributed forces for a standing army.  [[Mordecai Reverence]] spent a long time in the region and has a particularly dark past associated with [[Minatota]] and its leader, [[Arwen Gryffon]].

[[Uvam Dynasty]] and [[Ehobel]] have a large bridge that connects them called [[Goldpass Bridge]] that is used for trade between the two nations.
