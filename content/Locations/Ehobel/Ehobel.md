The home nation of the Elves in [[The Amber Realms]]. Around the time of [[The Sundering]] Ehobel and [[The Dawn Empire]] were on good terms as they had just fought in a war with each other. However, some time after the events of the war the two nations fell out and now they are on the verge of war with each other again. 

It is assumed that the two nations are on bad terms with each other due to a difference in ideology between [[Galen Verix]] and [[Ashira Yelris â€ ]] on how to use and protect [[The Towers]].

The capital, [[Ishnmel]] is known to have an extremely large library. 

[[Uvam Dynasty]] and [[Ehobel]] have large bridge that connects them called [[Goldpass Bridge]] that is used for trade between the two nations.
