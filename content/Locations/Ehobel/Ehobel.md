The home nation of the Elves in [[The Amber Realms]] and led by The Empress, [[Obeus Yelris]]. Obeus took over the role of Empress from her mother [[Ashira Yelris â€ ]] some years ago. he is described in books as a very kind and understanding ruler and has "grand military plans". In reality, She doesn't leave the palace enough to understand the situation of her lands, let alone what i happening with her people. Ehobel was one of the main factions that made up [[The Coalition]] during [[The Sundering]]. During this period Ehobel had a very good relationship with [[The Dawn Empire]] after many wars. However, sometime after the Sundering, the nations began to despise each other again, causing [[4th Dawn vs Ehobel War]] which sprouted the offshoot nation called The [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)]].
