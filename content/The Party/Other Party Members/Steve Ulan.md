### Overview
Steve Ulan was found in one of the cells in the dungeon of [[The Red Cult]] at the start of the campaign. When he was first found he was incredibly racist and had many gaps in his memory. As he adventured with [[The Party]] it was eventually revealed that he was the son of the [[Lord Ulan †|Lord of Steelwick]] and had run away years ago. 

The majority of his memories returned when the party journeyed to [[steelwick]] and explored his room and the dungeons. In the dungeons, he learnt that his father had tortured and murdered his girlfriend [[Mistrel †]]. This filled him with rage and led him to murdering his father and go to trial for it.

### Description 
Steve is described as a bland bland-looking human with a receding hairline and no remarkable features. 

### Personality
Initially, Steve was unreliable and quite racist, especially since [[The Party]] was comprised of many different races. Over time he grew to be more tolerant and even started to idolise the party due to the acceptance of him and actions due to [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]], going as far as to create [[The Hero Cult]].

### Other Information
- Steve isn't a very good fighter but tries hard to not be a burden to the party and his friends.
- He travelled with [[The Party]] as a [[Companion]] for a long time before being left in the [[The War for the OFC's Freedom|OFC]] to manage the cult and other affairs while they're not in the country

### Trivia
- [[James Absolom]] James originally planned for [[The Party]] to kill Steve because he was so racist and so had to quickly develop a back story for him since [[The Party]] showed no sign of letting him go. >:)
