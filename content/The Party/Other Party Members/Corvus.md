### Overview
Corvus is Corvum that [[The Party]] found living in [[Iron Forge]] when they accompanied [[Strixhaven]] researchers to investigate the city. He was originally spotted by [[The Korrigan]] hiding in the dark, Corvus was very weary of them since he originally moved to the city to get away from the people of the surface who made too much noise. Eventually, Korrigan convinced him to travel with [[The Party]] as it seemed like the Stronghold was going be raided soon by more researchers and the [[Goblin Mafia]] and that they could help them move out. He has been travelling as a [[Companion]] ever since, although he doesn't talk much
