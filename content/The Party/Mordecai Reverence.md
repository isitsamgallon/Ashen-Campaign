### Overview
Mordecai Reverence is a Tiefling who is from somewhere in the [[Uvam Dynasty]]. They are a Sorcerer/Bard multi-class and a member of [[The Party]]. Renowned for their dramatic flair and innate magical aptitude, Mordecai is often both the heart of the group's charm and a source of their tension. His aversion to fire magic and knack for theatrical improvisation have made him a standout figure in their journeys. Played by [[Rowan Hales]].

### Personality
Mordecai's personality is flamboyant, with a penchant for verbal wit and an almost insatiable need for attention. He often speaks with dramatic overtones, incorporating sarcasm and a flair for the extravagant in his interactions. Despite this bravado, Mordecai demonstrates a deep sense of loyalty to his companions, though he occasionally masks vulnerability with biting humour. Throughout the story, his experiences with gods and otherworldly threats push him to confront his self-serving tendencies, revealing a more complex character grappling with fear, responsibility, and a growing connection to his team.

### Description
Visually striking, Mordecai has crimson skin that gleams like polished ruby and horns that curve gracefully backwards, framing his sharp, angular features. His bright, ostentatious clothing—often adorned with elaborate jewellery and a fur cloak—reflects his bold personality. His glowing golden eyes exude confidence, while his sleek tail, tipped with an arcane shimmer, adds an air of mystique. Mordecai's movements are fluid, theatrical, and deliberate, giving the impression that he is always performing for an unseen audience.

### Backstory Summary
Mordecai was a young child when their magic activated randomly, causing a massive fireball to launch inside of his family home. The house fire that ensued caused the death of their [[Mordecai's Mother|Mother]] and some of their siblings. It was later revealed that their father and brother survived the fire and have been hunting Mordecai down ever since. 

Sometime later they arrived in [[Minatota]] where they joined the [[Nightshade's Crown]] to make money, eventually catching the eye, and obsessive love, of [[Arwen Gryffon]]. They later broke free of their work there and soon found themselves captured by [[The Red Cult]].

### Trivia
- Mordecai's mini is based on the female character model on Eldritch Foundry because the male models weren't "Twinky enough".
- Due to a series of misunderstandings, Drache ships Mordecai and Chenris - much to their dismay 
- Mordecai canonically does drag and has even put [[The Korrigan]] and [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] in their own drag costumes at times.
