Merek the Wise is the leader of a small level 1 adventuring party made up of entirely halflings. [[The party]] first met them on their way to [[Steelwick]] when they wanted to go kill a dragon. Unfortunately this dragon ended up being the Wyvern that killed [[Korrigan]]. Most of [[the party]] don't like them since they partially blame them for his death. 

Wrote a book about the fight painting him and his party in a very good light, unfortunately makes the main party look like shit.

[[Korrigan]] on meeting merek after his death, took him to the fey wilds, threatened him and then gifted him a staff. He then used this as leverage to ask a favour of which merek was obliged to do. Korrigan had Merek investigating the [[The Ethertwist Haunter]]

In party with:
- [[Derek]]
- [[Serek]]
- [[Jerek â€ ]]
