### Overview
A part of a small level 1 adventuring party made up of completely Halflings. They were encountered on the [[Verdant Spine]] on their own quest to kill a dragon. Unfortunately, this dragon ended up being the Wyvern that killed [[Kal ‡]]. 

### Party Members 
- [[Jerek The Smooth †]]
- [[Derek The Brave]]
- [[Serek The Quick]]

### Notable Information
- Merek wrote a book about the fight with the wyvern painting him and his party in a much better light. The book was also written in such a way that [[The Party]] were made to look pathetic. 
- After [[The Korrigan]] 's rebirth, he eventually found Merek while staying in [[Steelwick]] and took him to the [[Feywild]] s to strike some fear into him and to make Merek owe him. He then used this favour to force Merek to investigate was was the traitor and messed up [[The Black Ritual]].
- Through magic, Merek was then able to identify [[Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] as the traitor.
