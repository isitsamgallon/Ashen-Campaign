### Overview
Genevieve is the former leader of [[The Emerald Fort]] and a known [[Perpetual]]. Before her death, she ran the fort for over 200 years but her family have controlled the fort for 1000s of years. She fought in [[The Sundering]] as a part of [[The Coalition]] and is considered a fair leader, but extremely money-driven. During [[The Party]]'s first encounter with her, she revealed [[Caden SteelBreaker †]]'s previous allegiance to [[The Dawn Empire]] and his involvement in [[The Sundering]]. Genevieve also remembers [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] from before he left [[The Tulan Fort]] to chase after his lover [[Emmeline]], a member of her fort. Thankfully she didn't punish Drache but was disappointed in him for abandoning his post causing someone else to leave theirs. 

[[Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Party]] managed to negotiate a deal with her to defend the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]] from [[The Dawn Empire]]. They had to make a deal that included the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]] giving a 40% cut of all taxes and bribes/ extortion money.

### Notable Information
Genevieve played an important role during [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. She was monumental in aiding the war effort and organising troops for [[The Party]]'s war plans. During the war, she took charge of the airships and was monumental in gaining air superiority. Genevieve's biggest act during the war was also her greatest sacrifice, she sacrificed her life for [[The Party]] in their final moments to make sure the war was won and that the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]] was free.
