Witherfeather is a powerful mage that was first mentioned by [[Korrigan]] as a way to break [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] out of this contract with the [[Ivory Crest]]. It was revealed that Korrigan was also a part of the [[Ivory Crest]] 5 years ago but Terrance helped him escape the contact hen the effect weakened over time. He freed both of them by transferring the ownership over to a new party and then giving them the contract so that they were always in control. 

Not long after this happened, Terrence was chased out of [[Dawnhaven]] 3 years ago to the current story, for presumably freeing a lot of the [[ivory crest]]'s slaves. Terence was then captured in [[Nightshade's Crown]] by [[Arwen Gryffon]] and was forced to use his powers to help mug people and in-slave them to Arwen. This is presumably where he also met [[Mordecai Reverence]]. Witherfeather was instrumental in fighting during [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]], Him and [[Agolin Winterbor]] were used by [[Chenris Tallfellow â€ ]] to create very stormy weather to stop [[The Dawn Empire]] from being able to attack the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]] by sea.
