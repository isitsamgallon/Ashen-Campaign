### Overview
Witherfeather is a powerful mage that was first mentioned by [[The Korrigan]] as a way to break [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] out of this contract with the [[Ivory Crest]]. It was revealed that Korrigan was also a part of the [[Ivory Crest]] 5 years ago and Terrance helped him escape the contact when the effect weakened over time. He freed both of them by transferring the ownership over to a new party and then giving them the contract so that they were always in control. 

### Notable Information
- 3 years before the start of the story he was chased out of [[Dawnhaven]], presumably for freeing many slaves.
- Terence was then captured in [[Nightshade's Crown]] by [[Arwen Gryffon]] and was forced to use his powers to help steal from people and in-slave them to Arwen. This is presumably where he also met [[Mordecai Reverence]]. 
- Witherfeather was instrumental in fighting during [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]], Him and [[Agolin Winterbor]] were used by [[Chenris Tallfellow â€¡]] to create very stormy weather to stop [[The Dawn Empire]] from being able to attack the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]] by sea. 
- After korrigan asked him if there was any way to stop someone form influencing and changing his memories, Terrence told a story of how he was once being fucked in the head by a ghost and created his own version of the [[Crown of Trues Sight]] and suggested they go and find that.
