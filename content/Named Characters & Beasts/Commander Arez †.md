 A high-up Dragonborn commander in [[The Dawn Empire]]. He was only ever seen wearing his armour made from pelts and hides made from the many strong beasts he had slain over the years. From the way he fought and presented himself, Arez was a massive pervert who took great joy in killing and taunting his prey. He was killed, alongside [[Caden SteelBreaker â€ ]], in [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]]. His most memorable moment during the fight was when he counter-charmed [[The Korrigan]] and had him attack [[The Party]]. Korrigan was able to break free and ripped him apart with [Thorn Whip](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thorn-whip) towards the end of the fight.
