A powerful dwarf that was first encountered in [[The Tulan Fort]] in [[Session 23]]. He initially seemed loyal to the fort's leader [[Damascus Klyn â€ ]] until he was about to kill [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]], at which point he stepped in and killed Klyn. He then allowed the party to escape among the chaos of the fort as an uprising occurred. He is extremely honour-bound and merciless in what he does. It's an easy decision for Bronzehand to kill useless people and torture people for information, as shown when he suggested killing [[Emmeline]] because she refused to give them useful information.
