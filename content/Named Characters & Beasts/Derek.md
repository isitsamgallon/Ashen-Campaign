Party of the small level 1 adventuring party made up of entirely halflings. [[The party]] first met them on their way to [[Steelwick]] when they wanted to go kill a dragon. Unfortunately this dragon ended up being the Wyvern that killed [[The Korrigan]]. Most of [[the party]] don't like them since they partially blame them for his death. 

Wrote a book about the fight painting him and his party in a very good light, unfortunately makes the main party look like shit.

In party with:
- [[Serek]]
- [[Merek The Wise]]
