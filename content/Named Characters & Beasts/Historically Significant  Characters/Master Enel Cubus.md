The Dean of the [[Mage's Guild]] is located in the [[Blackwall]]. He has allegedly been out travelling for the past 5 years, but no one has heard from him in a long time. [[Chenris Tallfellow]] wants to find Cubus as he is potentially the only one who might know what causes [[Agolin Winterbor]] to go mad. In [[Session 19]], Chenris searches the dean's office and finds a [[Map to Itone]] and notes mentioning [[Eldertide]] giving them possible clues as to his whereabouts.
