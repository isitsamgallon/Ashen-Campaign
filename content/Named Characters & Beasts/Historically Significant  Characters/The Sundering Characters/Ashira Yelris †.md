After the war she found herself trapped in a love triangle with [[Caden SteelBreaker â€ ]] and Galen. Ultimately fell for Caden but its considered Taboo to marry humans in Elvin culture so she promised to love Caden forever in secret.

Soon after she retuned to [[Ehobel]], she was known to constantly leave the palace at night time and only return in the early hours of the morning looking incredibly drained. Over time she became so weak that she passed away. Before she died she did give birth to a daughter called [[Obeus Yelris]].
