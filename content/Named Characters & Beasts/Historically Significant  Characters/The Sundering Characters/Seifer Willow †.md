### Overview
One of the chief tacticians for [[Ignatius]] 's army during [[The Sundering]]. She faced off against [[General Midus â€ ]] many times during the way. She was said to be a brutal commander who would sacrifice anything to achieve her lord's goals. At one point she was said to to use massive fiery explosions that not only destroyed [[The Coalition]] 's forces but also her [[Ash Spawn]] forces.

She devised a plan to lure [[the coalition]] forces into a trap. Her [[Ash Spawn]] huddled closely around her, forming a living shield of fiery death. As [[the coalition]] army encircled them, Seifer unleashed the full power of [[Ignatius]], sacrificing herself and her comrades to obliterate the enemy.
