### Overview
The Grand Architect. A mysterious member of [[The Auditors]] who was the primary creator of [[The Ancient Pillars]] and is specifically mentioned as the person who created [[The Tower of Ishnmel]] with the help of [[Ashira Yelris â€ ]]. 

### Notable Information
- They were first mentioned in [[The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult]] in a very negative light. This was most likely due to him creating [[The Towers]] that used to hold back the Gods - including [[Ignatius]]. They also seem to be connected to [[The All Father]] due to their involvement with [[The Towers]] and their ability to drain [[The All Father]] 's power.
