The Grand Architect. A mysterious member of [[The Auditors]] who was the primary creator of [[The Ancient Pillars]] and is specifically mentioned as the person who created [[The Tower of Ishnmel]] with the help of [[Ashira Yelris â€ ]]. 

They were first mentioned in [[The Sundering - As told by The Ashen Cult]] in a very negative light. This was most likely due to him creating [[The Towers]] that used to hold back the Gods - including [[Ignatius]].
