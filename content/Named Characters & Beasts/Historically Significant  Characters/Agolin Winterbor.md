Winterbor is a mad wizard found in the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]]. He is currently located in the basement of the [[Mage's Guild]], Where they put all of their problem wizards. According to great wizards such as [[Terence Witherfeather]] and [[Master Enel Cubus]], he was an amazingly mage that outclassed many in terms of sheer knowledge and power. He had a particular interest in weather and weather manipulation, however at some point he was driven mad some time a go and it isn't clear how. 

During [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]], [[Chenris Tallfellow â€¡]] went to go meet Winterbor to ask he was able to manipulate the weather to create a storm to stop enemy ships forming able to approach. He agreed but not before two [[Magic Demons]] appeared on his shoulder telling Chenris "You don't want to know".

Chenris theories that these demons are linked to Winterbor's sudden decent into madness.
