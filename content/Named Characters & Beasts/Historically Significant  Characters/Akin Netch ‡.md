The man of many faces and the founder of [[The Auditors]]. While others sought power from the gods, [[Akin Netch ‡]] rejected their influence. He understood the delicate balance of the world, where the presence of gods would tip the scales toward chaos. It is said that he wore many faces, adopting new identities as needed, drifting through courts and battlefields as both a noble lord and a common beggar. His true face was never seen by mortal eyes, for Akin believed that no single identity could serve the many purposes he embodied. 

He sacrificed his life during [[The Sundering]] to help keep the gods from interacting with [[The Amber Realms]]. He did this by trapping the gods beyond the [[Ember Peak]]’s flames. His essence, bound to the fires of the peak, became the eternal guardian of the realm, preventing the gods from ever again crossing into the world of men.
