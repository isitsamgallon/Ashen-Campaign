The captain that looks after [[Silkhorn]]. After rescuing [[Chenris Tallfellow â€¡]], [[Mordecai Reverence]] and [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]] from [[The Red Cult]] at the start of the campaign, he guides them back to [[Silkhorn]] for a place to temporarily stay. He's a Avery kind man, offering [[The Party]] shelter on many occasions, even when [[The Party]] wasn't very well received in the area. 

The Captain Bridges seemed to be very proud of his name and position in the military, often getting pissed off if people forgot or misremembered him.
