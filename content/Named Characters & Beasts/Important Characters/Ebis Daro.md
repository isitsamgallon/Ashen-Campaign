# History 
[[The Party]] first met Ebis in the [[Wooden Hearth Inn]] in [[Ishnmel]] ([[Session 15]]). The group of Drache, Mordecai and [[Aidan Knight]] went to gain more knowledge on [[Aetherion]]. At the time [[Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] and [[The Korrigan]] had been secretly plotting and researching the being behind everyones back and Mordecai was determine to not be out done by Chenris wanted to learn more than them. 

In the tavern, Mordecai starts to perform a self written ballad about [[The War for the OFC's Freedom]] to wet their appetite. People seem to enjoy it and even chuck some coin at him. While this is happening drache sits and the bar (which is unusual for this establishment) and asks for a class of wine and watches the crowd. After Mordecai is done with his first Ballad, he starts another about [[Aetherion]], however he purposely tries to get a lot information wrong to see if anyone reacts. Most patrons are sitting there, enjoying the music -apart form one, an old man he start disagreeing with many of the things that Mordecai purposely gets wrong. Drache approaches him and they start to chat about the true history of [[Aetherion]]. After their chat, he introduces himself as [[Ebis Daro]] and can meet him at the Mages Guild if they wont to find out more. 

Later on he is seen again during the destruction of [[The Tower of Ishnmel]]. When Mordecai is frantically trying to get to chenris at the top of the tower, he appears and creates a lift up to the top before flying up there himself. At the top of the tower, he can be found helping Chenris destroy the crystal and stopping Mordecai from doing anything. At one point he could be found transforming into [[Mordecai's Mother †]] in attempt to break Mordecai and stop him from interfering. Once the crystal is destroyed, he helps Chenris channel the energy wherever he wants it and secretly tells Mordecai, "You've done a great thing for [[Ignatius]]". 

The next day [[Chenris Tallfellow ‡]] asks for a private meeting him to ask questions about [[Master Enel Cubus]] and his disappearance. He isn't able to help with a lot of details but points him in the right direction. After this, Chenris leans in and asks about him transforming in to Mordecai's mother. Ebis denies knowing anything about this but after some pushing he gets up locks the door and transforms into the leader of [[The Red Cult]], then quickly into Suicide bomber from the airship. He then switches back into to Ebis, unlocks the door and says "And no one will believe you".
