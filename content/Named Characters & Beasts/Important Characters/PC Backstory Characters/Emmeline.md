She is [[Wurinn 'Drache' Fuuldrusch]]'s lover from [[The Emerald Fort]]. When they first met, Drache was a part of [[The Tulan Fort]] and would sneak out, abandoning post sometimes, to go see her. For a long time not much was known about her until Drache talked with [[Genevieve †]] and learned that she was last spotted heading for Tulan, not aware he was in the [[Organisation of Free Cities (OFC)|OFC]] with [[The Party]] at the time.

In [[Session 23]], Drache was finally able to free her from Tulan by sneaking into the fort at night. They found her hung upside down in a torture room, beaten and bloodied. Although she had been tortured for possibly a long time, she still had her old sarcastic humour and seemed to be in high spirits. She was shackled with magical cuffs, that required a key to open them so the party left to find the key and free her. However, along the way [[Damascus Klyn †]] and [[Vormomli Bronzehand]], were spotted heading to the torture chamber and discussing how they wanted to kill her. They sent [[Mordecai Reverence]] to investigate but lost contact with the Tiefling soon after and entered themselves to find both Mordecai and Emmeline unconscious on the floor and Klyn waiting for a duel. After a long drawn-out battle, Drache managed to beat his old boss and save both of them.
