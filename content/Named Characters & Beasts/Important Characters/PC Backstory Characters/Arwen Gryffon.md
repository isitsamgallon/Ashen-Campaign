Arwen is a very obese half-elf, who was first mentioned by [[Cindy]] and is the owner of the [[Nightshade's Crown]] in [[Minatota]]. In his office, there are many pictures of [[Mordecai Reverence]] with his eye cut out. There are many dead Tieflings under the pictures, written above them, presumably in their blood "Mordecai stole my heart". 

Arwen is known to have worked with the [[Goblin Mafia]] but it is unknown to what end. He had also kidnapped [[Terence Witherfeather]] and was forcing him to rob the clients of the Nightshade's Crown
