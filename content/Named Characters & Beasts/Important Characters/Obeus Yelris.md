The Current Emperor of [[Ehobel]]. She is described in books as a very kind and understanding ruler and has "grand military plans". In reality, She doesn't leave the palace enough to understand the situation of her lands, let alone what i happening with her people. 

One of the reasons why she is unable to leave the palace is because of her weal constitution due to her being a half elf. It is revealed that she is the daughter of [[Ashira Yelris †]] and [[Caden SteelBreaker †]]. Half-Elves are incredibly rare, if they don't die during childbirth, they often have complications laters in life.

When [[The Party]] first met her, she was locked up in the inner sanctum and had never been outside. They had come to propose trade agreements and warn her of the Bandits nearby with [[Grom]]. For the first time being interest in the outside world, she demands that [[The Party]] break her out and take her on an adventure.
