The former lord of [[Steelwick]]. he was very unfit a horrible man, especially to his son [[Steve Ulan]]. He notably didn't even know if his son was even alive assuming he had be locked up in his room for the last decade, when in reality he had escaped some years ago. He also tortured and killed his son's lover [[Mistrel â€ ]].

The lord notably wasn't always as bad as he was when [[The Party]] met him. After investigating Steve's room, [[The Party]] found his diary describing his father as a very kind and caring man until some unknown event turned him into the sick and twisted man that he is now. 

He was later killed by Steve when he escaped [[The Party]] so he could get revenge for his lover.
